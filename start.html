                    <h3 id="h3style">Why?</h3>
                    <p id="p-about">This program was written for a school project as part of a course. The requirements were communicated to us gradually, and we tried our best until it worked. The project was structured according to the SCRUM principle to learn the system. For this project, we had half a year, where we had a Sprint Review every 3 weeks and a Daily Scrum meeting every week, as we only had 4 hours per week.</p> <br>

                <div id="who">
                    <h3 id="h3style">Who&How?</h3>
                    <p id="p-about-right">Our team consists of 3 students who tried to solve the project in synchronization with each other. In addition to programming, we also invested a lot of time in planning to achieve the best possible result. In the beginning, we brainstormed the user stories that we wanted to implement and assigned a value (story points) to them so that we knew the importance of features for the customer. After that, we selected various user stories that we wanted to implement in a sprint (3 weeks).</p> <br>

                    <h3 id="h3style">What?</h3>
                    <p id="p-about">The connection to the Mbot is facilitated through TCP/UDP, requiring an internet connection between the website and Mbot. Additionally, up to 3 MBots can be connected, and users can choose which one to control. The control can be done using a keyboard, controller (PS4, XBOX One), or even touch for mobile devices.</p> <br>

                <p class="side-text">"Engaging in a collaborative school project at HTL proved to be an enriching experience, transcending traditional classroom learning. Our diverse team brought together unique skills, from coding proficiency to creative thinking, creating a dynamic blend. Guided by SCRUM methodologies, the project unfolded with iterative development and regular team meetings, emphasizing open communication. This structured approach enhanced our project's quality and provided real-world insights into agile methodologies. The time constraints underscored the importance of efficient resource management and consistent deadline adherence, mirroring real-world scenarios. Beyond technical aspects, the project cultivated essential soft skills like teamwork, leadership, and effective communication. As students, the project served as a bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical application, offering insights into real-world challenges. The camaraderie within the team contributed to a positive working environment and lasting bonds among members. In essence, the HTL project was a holistic journey integrating technical expertise with practical application, theoretical knowledge with real-world problem-solving, and individual contributions with collective achievements. This experience not only prepared us for future careers but also instilled a mindset focused on collaboration, innovation, and continual learning in the dynamic field of technology."</p>
